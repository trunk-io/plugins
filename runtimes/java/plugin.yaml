  # NOTE(sam): We use Azul's Zulu builds of OpenJDK because it was the first thing we found when
  # implementing the Java runtime. The Temurin releases are hosted on GitHub, which would allow us
  # to use "latest version query" logic on them, but their release naming isn't trivially compatible
  # with our current schema (e.g. JDK 11.0.17+8 has URL /jdk-11.0.17+8/[...]_11.0.17_8.tar.gz).
