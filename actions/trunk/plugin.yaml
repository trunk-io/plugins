      # We do not auto-suggest turning on check pre-commit for several reasons:
      # - Linters can often be much slower than formatters, and we don't want to unnecessarily block iteration.
      # - The trunk-fmt-pre-commit action is usually sufficient for enforcing style.
      # - It's often desired to temporarily commit code that has linter issues.
      # - If you prefer to use linter autofixes, you can override the run command to use `-y` instead of `-n`.
